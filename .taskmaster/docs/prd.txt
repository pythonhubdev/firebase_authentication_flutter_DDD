# Product Requirements Document: Firebase Authentication Flutter DDD App

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for updating and improving the Firebase Authentication Flutter DDD application. The primary goals are to migrate to the latest stable version of Riverpod, modernize the user interface, and improve the overall quality and maintainability of the codebase.

## 2. Key Features and Improvements

### 2.1. Riverpod 3.0 Migration

The application currently uses a pre-release version of Riverpod 3.0. This should be updated to the latest stable release of Riverpod 3.0. This migration will involve:

- Updating the `hooks_riverpod` dependency in `pubspec.yaml`.
- Refactoring the existing providers and widgets to align with the latest Riverpod 3.0 APIs.
- Ensuring that the state management is robust and efficient.

### 2.2. UI Modernization

The current user interface is basic and can be significantly improved. The new UI should be:

- **Modern and visually appealing:** Adopt a clean and modern design language (e.g., Material You).
- **User-friendly:** The user experience should be intuitive and seamless.
- **Responsive:** The UI should adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

This will involve:

- Redesigning the login, registration, and home pages.
- Creating a consistent theme and style guide.
- Adding animations and transitions to enhance the user experience.

### 2.3. Code Refactoring and Cleanup

The codebase should be refactored to improve its quality, readability, and maintainability. This includes:

- **Updating dependencies:** All dependencies should be updated to their latest stable versions.
- **Improving error handling:** Implement a more robust error handling mechanism to gracefully handle exceptions and provide clear feedback to the user.
- **Enhancing validation:** Strengthen the input validation for the login and registration forms.
- **Code organization:** Ensure that the code is well-organized and follows the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD).

### 2.4. Enhanced Authentication Flow

The authentication flow can be improved by adding the following features:

- **Password reset:** Allow users to reset their passwords if they forget them.
- **Email verification:** Send a verification email to new users to ensure that they have provided a valid email address.
- **Social logins:** Add support for social logins (e.g., Google, Apple) to provide users with more options for signing in.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The application should be performant and responsive, with minimal jank or lag.
- **Security:** The application should be secure and protect user data.
- **Scalability:** The architecture should be scalable to accommodate future growth and new features.

## 4. Future Enhancements

- **Profile page:** A user profile page where users can view and edit their information.
- **Two-factor authentication:** Add an extra layer of security with two-factor authentication.
- **Offline support:** Cache data locally to provide a seamless experience even when the user is offline.
